# DengueClimateProject

Repository for the research project: **Climatic Understanding of Dengue Spread in Urban Landscapes** under Dr. Kaushik Jana and Dr. Aditya Vaishya.

I am working as a research assistant performing exploratory data analysis on dengue and meteorological datasets of Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

The goals of this project are:

1. Find the link between dengue cases and meteorological parameters like temperature, humidity, and rainfall

2. Model rainfall and humidity by using Generalized Extreme Value Distribution. This will help in finding the link with dengue outbreaks.
